    "ReviewText": " Amazing! I can’t believe that this Laptop with a Intel Celeron N5095 quad-core processor, 20GB RAM, and a spacious 512GB SSD only sell for 300$! This laptop is a game-changer when it comes to performance and efficiency, making it a perfect choice for both work and play. I purchased two at the first sight without thinking last month! One for backup windows (I have a macbook pro for my business), the other for my kids. He needs a laptop for school course and games. I must say it has exceeded our expectations in every way.\n\nFirst and foremost, the N5095's CPU is an absolute cost-effective quad-core processor. With 2.9 ghz turbo frequency, 4 cores and 4threads, it effortlessly handles demanding tasks with ease. Whether I'm multitasking, running office software, or playing games, like sims4 and minecraft, this laptop never fails to deliver smooth and lag-free performance.\n\nThe 20GB RAM is another standout feature of this laptop. It provides ample memory to ensure seamless multitasking and effortless switching between applications. I no longer have to worry about slowdowns or memory-related issues, as the generous RAM capacity keeps everything running smoothly, even with multiple applications running simultaneously.\n\nThe inclusion of a 512GB SSD is a real game-changer within 300$ when it comes to storage. Not only does it provide lightning-fast boot times and quick file access, but it also offers ample space to store all my files, documents, media, and games. The SSD significantly enhances the overall performance of the laptop, allowing for quick data transfers and reducing load times in applications.\n\nIn terms of design and build quality, this laptop is sleek and thin, even though it not as thin as Microsoft surface book. My kid usually carries it to school, so portability is another aspect I need to take into consideration. The laptop's compact and lightweight design makes it highly portable, perfect for professionals"
